# Online Ticket Booking Agency

Welcome to the Online Ticket Booking Agency repository! This project aims to provide a platform for local ticket booking agencies to buy and sell tickets through email communications. With the absence of a proper application for this purpose, this project fills the gap by offering a streamlined and convenient solution.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: The application is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and efficient client-side navigation.

- TypeScript: The project utilizes TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, for improved code reliability and developer productivity.

- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application, providing a utility-first approach to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

- Superbase: Superbase is the chosen database for this project, offering a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data.

## Functionalities

1. Account Creation: Local ticket sellers can create an account on the platform, providing their necessary details and information.

2. Content Publishing: Sellers can publish their available tickets, specifying details such as event name, date, location, price, and quantity.

3. Ticket Purchase: Users can log in to the application and browse the available tickets. They can then proceed to purchase the desired tickets directly from the sellers.
